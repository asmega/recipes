name: Lemon drizzle with orange blossom extract
ingredients:
- butter, softened: 115g
- golden caster sugar: 100g
- self-raising flour: 115g
- eggs: 2
- lemon zest, grated: 1
- lemon juice (for drizzle): 1
- icing sugar (for drizzle): 40g
- orange blossom extract: 1 tbsp
- vanilla paste: 1 ts
steps:
- Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.
- Mix the softened butter and the golden caster sugar until creamy, add the eggs one at a time and keep mixing.
- Add the self-raising flour, the grated lemon zest and mix until well combined.
- Spoon the mixture into a silicone loaf mould and level the top with a spoon.
- Bake for 40 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
- Once baked, while the cake is still in the mould, mix the lemon juice with the icing sugar to make the drizzle.
- Prick the cake all over with a skewer, then pour over the drizzle – the juice needs to sink in.
- Keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days (a week in the fridge), or freeze for up to 1 month.
