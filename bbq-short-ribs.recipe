name: BBQ beef short ribs
ingredients:
- beef short ribs: 2 x 1.5kg
- tomato ketchup: 180ml
- stout: 150ml
- Worcestershire sauce: 4 tablespoons
- English mustard: 1 heaped teaspoon
- malt vinegar: 4 teaspoons
- golden syrup: 4 teaspoons
steps:
- Preheat the oven to 100ºC/212ºF/gas ¼.
- Place the ribs in a snug-fitting roasting tray
- Season with sea salt and black pepper, drizzle with oil, then rub all over
- Cover tightly with a double layer of tin foil, then cook for 7 to 8 hours, or until tender.
- When the time’s up, transfer the ribs to a baking tray. Skim away the fat from the roasting tray and reserve in an airtight jar (use it for delicious roast potatoes another day).
- Place the roasting tray over a high heat on the hob and bring the juices to the boil. Simmer for around 2 minutes, then add the remaining sauce ingredients.  Bring back to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for a further 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and coats the back of a spoon.
- Brush most of the sauce onto the ribs so they’re nicely coated all over, then return the ribs to the oven for 20 to 40 minutes, or until sticky and caramelised to your liking.
