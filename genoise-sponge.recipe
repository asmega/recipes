name: Génoise Sponge
ingredients:
- eggs: 4
- sugar: 120g
- flour: 120g
steps:
- Combine the eggs and sugar in a mixing bowl or in the stand mixer recipient.
- Using a hand whisk, beat the preparation over a bain-marie. The temperature should reach roughly 40°C.
- Finish beating with an electric whisk until cooled down completely.  If you do not have an electric whisk, you can finish beating manually. The preparation is ready when doubled in volume.
- Add the sifted flour stirring gently with a rubber spatula or a skimmer, in rotating motions.
- Butter and flour a round cake tin. Pour the mixture and bake at 180°C (gas mark 4).
- The génoise sponge is ready when golden. To check whether the génoise is cooked, insert the blade of a knife in the cake. If nothing sticks to the blade, you can remove the dish from the oven.
- Remove from the mould. Leave to cool on a rack.
